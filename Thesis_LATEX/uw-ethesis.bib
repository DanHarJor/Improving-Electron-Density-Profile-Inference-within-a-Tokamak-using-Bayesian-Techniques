@article{reneintpol,
abstract = {•Ten channels with common retroreflectors and windows were repositioned in the WEST tokamak environment for a 0.1 normalized radius resolution.•Inner vessel mirrors close to the divertor allow the X point and edge plasma diagnose.•Digital electronics replaces the initial data processing electronics.•Data were routinely and trouble free produced for real time control at 1 ms sampling time and post pulse analysis with mixed 1 MHz and 1 ms sampling time during the 2 year first WEST plasma campaign.
In the frame of the WEST tokamak upgrade project, the Tore Supra combined interferometer-polarimeter diagnostic has been modified to fit the geometry and constraints induced by the implementation of divertor coils in the vacuum vessel. For a good spatial resolution of the plasma, as the vertical ports are now partially obstructed, 8 infrared beams go through a common horizontal port and are retro-reflected on an inner panel and 2 vertical port retro-reflected channels, with specific vacuum mirrors close to the divertor, could be implemented to diagnose the edge plasma.
The electronics and the data acquisition have also been renewed to improve the reliability and precision of the measurements. Novel digital electronics with embedded interferometric and polarimetric algorithms produce 1 ms data outputs for real time control.
The diagnostic has routinely been operated during the first WEST campaigns. In this article, we detail the new arrangement and discuss the first results with plasma.},

@article{nice,
abstract = {•Presentation of the code NICE (Newton direct and Inverse Computation for Equilibrium).•Plasma equilibrium computation (reconstruction, direct and inverse, static and quasi-static).•Details on numerical methods implemented in the code.•Toroidal harmonics, Finite Element method, Newton method, Sequential Quadratic Programming.•Several computation examples are provided for different tokamaks.
The code NICE (Newton direct and Inverse Computation for Equilibrium) enables to solve numerically several problems of plasma free-boundary equilibrium computations in a tokamak: plasma free-boundary only reconstruction and magnetic measurements interpolation, full free-boundary equilibrium reconstruction from magnetic measurements and possibly internal measurements (interferometry, classical linear approximation polarimetry or Stokes model polarimetry, Motional Stark Effect and pressure), direct and inverse, static and quasi-static free-boundary equilibrium computations.
NICE unifies and upgrades 3 former codes VacTH [1], EQUINOX [2] and CEDRES++ [3]. The strength of NICE is to gather in a single finite element framework different equilibrium computation modes. It makes intensive use of Newton method and Sequential Quadratic Programming method to solve non linear problems.
NICE is used routinely for WEST tokamak operation. It is also adapted to the IMAS (ITER Modelling and Analysis Suite) format which makes it usable on many different fusion tokamak reactors.
In this document we give a general overview of the numerical methods implemented in NICE as well as a number of computation examples.},

@article{tokamakSchema,
abstract = {We consider the optimal tracking problem for a divergent-type parabolic PDE system, which can be used to model the spatial-temporal evolution of the magnetic diffusion process in a tokamak plasma. With the feedforward trajectories generated by numerical optimization, we derive a linear system to describe the error evolution. The weak variation approach is then extended to cylindrical coordinates to obtain a Riccati-type PDE for feedback kernel synthesis. Then, a finite difference method is used to give numerical solutions for the Riccati-type PDE. The obtained feedback kernel is finally used to simulate the closed-loop system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tracking method can attenuate the tracking error effectively.},

@article{westmagdiag,
abstract = {The WEST tokamak consists of a major upgrade of the superconducting medium size tokamak Tore Supra aiming at testing ITER divertor components. Such modification has required rebuilding a full set of magnetic diagnostics. The project was started in 2013 and completed in 2016. The diagnostic consists of a set of 469 sensors (421 pick-up coils, 36 flux loops, and 12 Rogowski coils) installed in the WEST vacuum vessel. New analog integrators have been developed in order to obtain the magnetic field and flux from the raw signal of the sensors. During the startup phase of WEST, plasma currents of the order of a few kilo amperes were measured despite much larger current of the order of hundreds of kilo amperes flowing in nearby conducting structures. The diagnostic is now fully operational and exhibits a noise level of about 0.5 mT on the magnetic field, and 2.0 mWb on flux loops allowing identifying the plasma boundary with an accuracy of a few millimeters on a 2 ms time cycle.},
