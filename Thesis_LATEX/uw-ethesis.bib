              Density peaking has been studied between an {ICRH} and {NBI} identity plasma in {JET}. The comparison shows that 8 {MW} of {NBI} heating/fueling increases the density peaking by a factor of two, being

              ) between the {ICRH} and {NBI} discharges is virtually zero. Both the gyro-kinetic simulations and integrated modelling strongly support the experimental result where the {NBI} fuelling is the main contributor to the density peaking for this identity pair. It is to be noted here that the integrated modeling does not reproduce the measured electron density profiles, but approximately reproduces the difference in the density profiles between the {ICRH} and {NBI} discharge. Based on these modelling results and the analyses, the differences between the two pulses in impurities, fast ions ({FIs}), toroidal rotation and radiation do not cause any such changes in the background transport that would invalidate the experimental result where the {NBI} fuelling is the main contributor to the density peaking. This result of

              increasing by a factor of 2 per 8 {MW} of {NBI} power is valid for the ion temperature gradient dominated low power H-mode plasmas. However, some of the physics processes influencing particle transport, like rotation, turbulence and {FI} content scale with power, and therefore, the simple scaling on the role of the {NBI} fuelling in {JET} is not necessarily the same under higher power conditions or in larger devices.},

abstract = {•Ten channels with common retroreflectors and windows were repositioned in the WEST tokamak environment for a 0.1 normalized radius resolution.•Inner vessel mirrors close to the divertor allow the X point and edge plasma diagnose.•Digital electronics replaces the initial data processing electronics.•Data were routinely and trouble free produced for real time control at 1 ms sampling time and post pulse analysis with mixed 1 MHz and 1 ms sampling time during the 2 year first WEST plasma campaign.
In the frame of the WEST tokamak upgrade project, the Tore Supra combined interferometer-polarimeter diagnostic has been modified to fit the geometry and constraints induced by the implementation of divertor coils in the vacuum vessel. For a good spatial resolution of the plasma, as the vertical ports are now partially obstructed, 8 infrared beams go through a common horizontal port and are retro-reflected on an inner panel and 2 vertical port retro-reflected channels, with specific vacuum mirrors close to the divertor, could be implemented to diagnose the edge plasma.
The electronics and the data acquisition have also been renewed to improve the reliability and precision of the measurements. Novel digital electronics with embedded interferometric and polarimetric algorithms produce 1 ms data outputs for real time control.
The diagnostic has routinely been operated during the first WEST campaigns. In this article, we detail the new arrangement and discuss the first results with plasma.},

abstract = {An inertial fusion implosion on the National Ignition Facility, conducted on August 8, 2021 (N210808), recently produced more than a megajoule of fusion yield and passed Lawson's criterion for ignition [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 075001 (2022)]. Here we describe the experimental improvements that enabled N210808 and present the first experimental measurements from an igniting plasma in the laboratory. Ignition metrics like the product of hot-spot energy and pressure squared, in the absence of self-heating, increased by ~ 35%, leading to record values and an enhancement from previous experiments in the hot-spot energy (~ 3×), pressure (~ 2×), and mass (~ 2×). These results are consistent with self-heating dominating other power balance terms. The burn rate increases by an order of magnitude after peak compression, and the hot-spot conditions show clear evidence for burn propagation into the dense fuel surrounding the hot spot. These novel dynamics and thermodynamic properties have never been observed on prior inertial fusion experiments.},

abstract = {The SPARC tokamak is a critical next step towards commercial fusion energy. SPARC is designed as a high-field ($B_0 = 12.2$ T), compact ($R_0 = 1.85$ m, $a = 0.57$ m), superconducting, D-T tokamak with the goal of producing fusion gain $Q>2$ from a magnetically confined fusion plasma for the first time. Currently under design, SPARC will continue the high-field path of the Alcator series of tokamaks, utilizing new magnets based on rare earth barium copper oxide high-temperature superconductors to achieve high performance in a compact device. The goal of $Q>2$ is achievable with conservative physics assumptions ($H_{98,y2} = 0.7$) and, with the nominal assumption of $H_{98,y2} = 1$, SPARC is projected to attain $Q \approx 11$ and $P_{\textrm {fusion}} \approx 140$ MW. SPARC will therefore constitute a unique platform for burning plasma physics research with high density ($\langle n_{e} \rangle \approx 3 \times 10^{20}\ \textrm {m}^{-3}$), high temperature ($\langle T_e \rangle \approx 7$ keV) and high power density ($P_{\textrm {fusion}}/V_{\textrm {plasma}} \approx 7\ \textrm {MW}\,\textrm {m}^{-3}$) relevant to fusion power plants. SPARC's place in the path to commercial fusion energy, its parameters and the current status of SPARC design work are presented. This work also describes the basis for global performance projections and summarizes some of the physics analysis that is presented in greater detail in the companion articles of this collection.},

The code NICE (Newton direct and Inverse Computation for Equilibrium) enables to solve numerically several problems of plasma free-boundary equilibrium computations in a tokamak: plasma free-boundary only reconstruction and magnetic measurements interpolation, full free-boundary equilibrium reconstruction from magnetic measurements and possibly internal measurements (interferometry, classical linear approximation polarimetry or Stokes model polarimetry, Motional Stark Effect and pressure), direct and inverse, static and quasi-static free-boundary equilibrium computations.
NICE unifies and upgrades 3 former codes VacTH [1], EQUINOX [2] and CEDRES++ [3]. The strength of NICE is to gather in a single finite element framework different equilibrium computation modes. It makes intensive use of Newton method and Sequential Quadratic Programming method to solve non linear problems.
NICE is used routinely for WEST tokamak operation. It is also adapted to the IMAS (ITER Modelling and Analysis Suite) format which makes it usable on many different fusion tokamak reactors.
In this document we give a general overview of the numerical methods implemented in NICE as well as a number of computation examples.},

abstract = {We consider the optimal tracking problem for a divergent-type parabolic PDE system, which can be used to model the spatial-temporal evolution of the magnetic diffusion process in a tokamak plasma. With the feedforward trajectories generated by numerical optimization, we derive a linear system to describe the error evolution. The weak variation approach is then extended to cylindrical coordinates to obtain a Riccati-type PDE for feedback kernel synthesis. Then, a finite difference method is used to give numerical solutions for the Riccati-type PDE. The obtained feedback kernel is finally used to simulate the closed-loop system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tracking method can attenuate the tracking error effectively.},

abstract = {The need to fit smooth temperature and density profiles to discrete observations is ubiquitous in plasma physics, but the prevailing techniques for this have many shortcomings that cast doubt on the statistical validity of the results. This issue is amplified in the context of validation of gyrokinetic transport models (Holland et al 2009 Phys. Plasmas 16 052301), where the strong sensitivity of the code outputs to input gradients means that inadequacies in the profile fitting technique can easily lead to an incorrect assessment of the degree of agreement with experimental measurements. In order to rectify the shortcomings of standard approaches to profile fitting, we have applied Gaussian process regression (GPR), a powerful non-parametric regression technique, to analyse an Alcator C-Mod L-mode discharge used for past gyrokinetic validation work (Howard et al 2012 Nucl. Fusion 52 063002). We show that the GPR techniques can reproduce the previous results while delivering more statistically rigorous fits and uncertainty estimates for both the value and the gradient of plasma profiles with an improved level of automation. We also discuss how the use of GPR can allow for dramatic increases in the rate of convergence of uncertainty propagation for any code that takes experimental profiles as inputs. The new GPR techniques for profile fitting and uncertainty propagation are quite useful and general, and we describe the steps to implementation in detail in this paper. These techniques have the potential to substantially improve the quality of uncertainty estimates on profile fits and the rate of convergence of uncertainty propagation, making them of great interest for wider use in fusion experiments and modelling efforts.},

Benefits from the integrated approach result from a systematic use of interdependencies; in that sense IDA optimizes the extraction of information from sets of different data. For that purpose IDA requires a systematic and formalized error analysis of all (statistical and systematic) uncertainties involved in each diagnostic. Bayesian probability theory allows for a systematic combination of all information entering the diagnostic model by considering all uncertainties of the measured data, the calibration measurements, and the physical model. Prior physics knowledge on model parameters can be included. Handling of systematic errors is provided. A central goal of the integration of redundant or complementary diagnostics is to provide information to resolve inconsistencies by exploiting interdependencies. A comparable analysis of sets of diagnostics (meta-diagnostics) is performed by combining statistical and systematical uncertainties with model parameters and model uncertainties. Diagnostics improvement and experimental optimization and design of meta-diagnostics will be discussed.},

In this work, the Bayesian probability inference has been applied to the frequency modulated continuous wave reflectometry and the Far-infrared laser interferometer diagnostic systems on HL-2A tokamak, offering the integrated data analysis (IDA) for electron density profile reconstruction. With the implementation, it is demonstrated that more comprehensive inference could be delivered from IDA compared to the traditional individual data analysis technique. The data analysis program based on the Bayesian inference model has been developed to reconstruct the two-dimensional electron density profile, which permits to be further implementation of the HL-2A/2M IDA framework in the near future.},
