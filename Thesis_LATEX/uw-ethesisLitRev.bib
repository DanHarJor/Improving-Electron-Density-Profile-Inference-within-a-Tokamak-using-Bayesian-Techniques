abstract = {Integrated data analysis (IDA) of fusion diagnostics is the combination of heterogeneous diagnostics to obtain validated physical results. Benefits from the integrated approach result from a systematic use of interdependencies; in that sense IDA optimizes the extraction of information from sets of different data. For that purpose IDA requires a systematic and formalized error analysis of all (statistical and systematic) uncertainties involved in each diagnostic. Bayesian probability theory allows for a systematic combination of all information entering the diagnostic model by considering all uncertainties of the measured data, the calibration measurements, and the physical model. Prior physics knowledge on model parameters can be included. Handling of systematic errors is provided. A central goal of the integration of redundant or complementary diagnostics is to provide information to resolve inconsistencies by exploiting interdependencies. A comparable analysis of sets of diagnostics (meta-diagnostics) is performed by combining statistical and systematical uncertainties with model parameters and model uncertainties. Diagnostics improvement and experimental optimization and design of meta-diagnostics will be discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract In fusion research, the diagnostic data are obtained from different diagnostic systems, which are relatively independent (in terms of the response function, noise, calibration, etcâ€¦). The consequence is that many measurements providing the same physical quantity could provide different results. In this work, the Bayesian probability inference has been applied to the frequency modulated continuous wave reflectometry and the Far-infrared laser interferometer diagnostic systems on HL-2A tokamak, offering the integrated data analysis (IDA) for electron density profile reconstruction. With the implementation, it is demonstrated that more comprehensive inference could be delivered from IDA compared to the traditional individual data analysis technique. The data analysis program based on the Bayesian inference model has been developed to reconstruct the two-dimensional electron density profile, which permits to be further implementation of the HL-2A/2M IDA framework in the near future.},
