\chapter{Methodology}

Explain the details of the how the theory is implimented, what processing power is required, I used python jupyter notebooks numpy, scipy and pytorch. Explain the key parts of the code in order to compute the kernels, marginal likelyhood and inference. What test were done in order to try and improve the inference. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item What format was the data in when it came from west and how did I import it into python
    \item A bit about the diffent forms the data comes in on the west imas database and which one was chosen. 
    \item How can the accuracy of the forward model be tested and how should this effect the experimental error.
    \item How does one select an experimental error, is it important for the inference? 
    \item What is the non positive definite matrix error, how can it be avoided, what are the implications of this
    \item How I used meshgrid to compute the kernel in a fast way
    \item what are the different methods used for finding the minimum of the marginal likelyhood, scipy minimize, pytorch, grid search. How do they work. 
    \item What distributions did I use to randomly initialize the kernel parameters. Why did I randomly initialise them?
    \item Why I coded everything with pytorch tensors
    \item How I optimised the learning rate
    \item Attempts to use noise
    \item How did I try and improve the inference.
    \item summarise the chapter and lead into the results.
