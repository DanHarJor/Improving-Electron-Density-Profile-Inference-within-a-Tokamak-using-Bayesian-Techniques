\chapter{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make the case as why a 0 mean prior is not always a good Idea, since the marginal likelyhood is not perfect and inferences favour the lower side of NICE, likely due to the 0 prior as when amp is increased the inference will move to NICE but not beyond it. Including prior knowledge when available is always advised.
    
    \item Make the case that if I set NICE as the true ground truth and create synthetic data then I get the NICE profile from lowering marginal likelyhood. This shows that everything is set up correctly.
    
    \item Show I am getting a local minimum of the marginal likelihood which is nice like and a lower minimum which is parabolic. This could be a result of the marginal likelihood not being a perfect loss function for problems with little data. This seems to be true for SciPy, PyTorch, static and non-static.
    \item Talk about the discovered more defined ridge, ask for access to log book to see if this is during a H-mode shot. Explain why it might be physically significant but a full monte carlo bayesian should be carried out to verify this. 
    \item Show the static grid search
