The electron density profile is a key parameter that affects the performance and stability of tokamak plasmas. To gain an understanding of turbulent particle transport many fusion devices are fitted with diagnostics capable of high-fidelity electron density profile measurements. For future fusion reactors such as DEMO, the design will be focused on fusion performance. This limits the diagnostics available whilst also pushing the plasma to the limits of its stability. It will be important to thoroughly make use of all available information for plasma control. Interferometry is a diagnostic that is planned to be implemented within DEMO and is currently implemented within the WEST tokamak. A Bayesian inference algorithm with a Gaussian process prior was developed to infer the electron density profile from WEST interferometry data. Both stationary and non-stationary kernels are trialled. Hyperparameters are handled with optimisation methods and a full Bayesian analysis; where the hyperparameters are marginalised. These methods are applied to synthetic interferometry data created from chosen ground truth electron density profiles and to interferometry data from a west shot where they can be compared to NICE \cite{nice}; an inference algorithm currently implemented on WEST data. The resulting inferences show that each technique can accurately infer specific ground truth profiles yet perform poorly on others. Further development is needed for a Bayesian inference method that performs well regardless of the ground truth profile.
